Computer security researchers say Internet worms are becoming more complex 
and could cause much more harm than previous versions: Internet Security 
Systems' X-Force research engineer Neel Mehta says the Blaster worm, for 
example, necessarily had to connect through a port usually blocked, thus 
hindering its ability to spread as fast as possible. Nimda, however, represents
a more complex worm in that it targeted internal networks and pieces of local 
networks that were easier to break into and live in. Zone Labs' Fred Felman 
agrees that worms could do more to penetrate systems by exploiting multiple 
vulnerabilities or finding other ways to propagate once inside the system. 
Gartner's Richard Stiennon warns against "low and slow" worm attacks that 
go unnoticed by administrators and security systems until they unleash a 
catastrophic attack, while Mehta says encryption advances could allow worms to 
carry more potent executables without being identified as doing so. A lot of 
the current security problems are the shared responsibility of users and software 
vendors, who create connected products that are easy to use but also more vulnerable 
to Internet attack. Enterprises can do more to protect themselves by adopting advanced 
firewalls that inspect packets and intrusion-detection systems that break down data 
into protocols instead of just matching patterns, and companies should also assess 
their security risks and write rules for when and how applications can connect to 
the Internet. Stiennon adds that organizations should not rely on a monolithic IT 
architecture, but vary their components in order to better contain possible break-ins.
