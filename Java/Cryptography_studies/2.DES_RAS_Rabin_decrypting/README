1. Implement the DES system in C++, Java, perl, etc. and then decrypt the ciphertext.
 
	     (NOTE: copy DES parameters and ciphertext from http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~xkzou/teaching/csci55500/ciphers/hw2-ciphers-parameter-matrix.zip.)
	     using key=8B2A7FF25E98C35D (in hexadecimal). The decrypted plaintext should be in 
	     normal english text, not in hexadecimal.
		(Hints: 
	        1. the ciphertext is in hexadecimal, therefore you need to translate every two
                  bytes in ciphertext into one byte in binary format. for example:
		B85D, when you read from the file, you get four chars:  B,8,5,D.
		B and 8 should change to one byte:10111000, and 5 and D shoud be 01011101.
		2. you need to skip the new line character.
		3. using the following result to verify your algorithm first:
		plaintext (in hexadecimal): 0123456789ABCDEF
		key  (in hexadecimal):      133457799BBCDFF1
		ciphertext(in hexadecimal): 85E813540F0AB405
		)
	
2. Decrypt the ciphertext encrypted by RSA method.
		The encoding for the RSA is as following:
		1) divide the plaintext into blocks.
		2) each block forms a big number as following:
		    (because all characters are from a 10X10 matrix) 
		    find the row and column number from the matrix
		    for the first character and the row number and column number 
		    are connected together to form a partial number; 
		    find the row and column number from the matrix 
		    for the second character, then append the
		    row number and column number to the above number,... 
      	            for example: This homework....
		    will be encoded to 527273830072798275... (because T is in 
		    row 5 and column 2. Note: the row and column numbers begin from Zero.)				
		3) encrypt each block using RSA method.
		4) Therefore, after your decryption, you need to decode by
		   changing every pair of two numbers (as row number and 
		   column number) into a character by looking up the matrix.
		5) you can get the ciphertext and matrix from http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~xkzou/teaching/csci55500/ciphers/hw2-ciphers-parameter-matrix.zip
		6) Every row in the ciphertext is an encrypted RSA number. So
                    you need to decrypt the ciphertext row by row.
		7) Here is the public key for this RSA system:
		    NN = 68102916241556953901301068745501609390192169871097881297 (modulo)
		    bb = 36639088738407540894550923202224101809992059348223191165 (public exponent)
		8) This problem needs big integer. There are several possibilities:
			a). use Java which contains BigInteger class.
			b). use GMP C library which contains operations on big integers
                            and has been installed in pegasus. Here is a simple program
                            to let you test and get familar with the usage of GMP library. 
 			    Here are the manual link: http://gmplib.org/manual/        
			    and the integer function link: http://gmplib.org/manual/Integer-Functions.html#Integer-Functions
			c). download C++ Big Integer Library from
                            https://github.com/panks/BigInteger
                        or  https://mattmccutchen.net/bigint/ 
			d). download LiDIA  Big Integer library from
			    https://github.com/mkoeppe/LiDIA 
			    LiDIA is primarily for Unix/Linux.
		9) There is a need to add one ZERO before the numbers having odd number of digits. 
		10) Since there is no factorization function in the above Libraries
                    you need to write your only Pollard p-1 factoring program to find the
	           factor of NN in this problem. Note: set B=1500.

		
3. Given the Rabin Cryptosystem p=199, q=211, n=pq
		1. Using the Rabin Cryptosystem ek(x)=x^2 mod n,
			a) Compute the encryption y = ek(32767)
			b) Determine the four possible decryptions of this given ciphertext y.

		2. Given a new Rabin Cryptosystem ek(x) = x(x+B) mod n, where B=1357
			a) Compute the encryption y = ek(32767)
			b) Determine the four possible decryptions of this given ciphertext y.
		
Good luck and have a fun!
