chirp! that is the sound of the long-sought gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime,
according to an announcement today from scientists working on the laser interferometer gravitational
wave observatory (ligo) experiment.

originally theorized by albert einstein in nineteen sixteen, gravitational waves have long been seen as
a bedrock of modern physics and astronomy, but it was not until today's blockbuster announcement that we
had proof they really existed. now scientists have confirmed that the twin ligo stations in louisiana and
washington state had detected the signal of two black holes merging one point three billion light years away
from earth in september twenty fifteen, and that this signal came in the form of an audible "chirp."

now you can hear the same mind-blowing cosmic sound for yourself thanks to emily lakdawalla of the planetary
society, who was on hand to catch a recording of the "chirp" played at the ligo announcement press conference
in washington, d.c. you first hear the voice of louisiana state physics and astronomy professor gabriela gonzales,
a ligo spokesperson, introducing the chirp.

shortly after the september event, ligo recorded another, weaker signal that was probably also from black holes, the team said. 
according to dr. weiss, there were at least four detections during the first ligo observing run, which ended in january. 
the second run will begin this summer. in the fall, another detector, advanced virgo, operated by the european gravitational 
observatory in italy, will start up. there are hopes for more in the future, in india and japan. 

as some have indicated on twitter, it could even be your next ringtone.
