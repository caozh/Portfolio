2. Open your putty window, and login into tesla server using your iu account.

3. In the root directory, use command "cd [folder]/[folder]" to find the source code folder.

4. In the root directory of source code folder, use command "make" to execute the "Makefile" to compile the code files.

5. Use command "rmiregistry 1888&" to registry port number 1888 for the program.

6. Use command "java -Djava.security.policy=policy MarketServer" to initiate the marketplace server.

7. Open anohter putty window, and again, login into tesla server using your iu account.

8. Using the same way as step 3, find source code folder.

9. In the root directory of source code folder, use command "java -Djava.security.policy=policy MarketClient" to initiate client program.

10. The login interface will be displayed if the client is successfully connected to the marketplace server over JAVA RMI.

11. You can login as customer or administrator. 
	Customer      -> username: "josephzelo", password: "asdasd"
	Administrator -> username: "admin",      password: "admin"
