 <h1>Certificate in Applied Computer Science</h1>
 <h2>Overview</h2>
 <p> 
 	The certificate program introduces computer science principles, develops practical skills in 
	market-driven software applications and prepares students to be successful with emerging 
	technologies. The program is designed to supplement and enhance a primary degree program. It 
	serves current IUPUI students and returning adults who are interested in gaining knowledge 
	and skills in computing applications. Those who earn the certificate will have demonstrated 
	that they have the core competencies necessary for entry-level positions in information 
	technology. They will have the ability to solve complex problems, design and implement 
	algorithms, apply computer science theory to practical problems, adapt to technological change 
 	and to program in at least two languages.
 </p>
 <p>
 	The certificate of applied computer science is a perfect companion for students in other degree 
	programs.&nbsp; For example, liberal arts students can earn a certificate of applied computer 
	science without adding time or credit hours to their degree process.&nbsp; For more information 
	on earning a certificate of applied computer science as a liberal arts major, 
	visit <a href="http://www.cs.iupui.edu/liberalArts/">http://www.cs.iupui.edu/liberalArts/</a>. &nbsp;Students in other degree programs who are interested in the certificate are 
	encouraged to visit an advisor to work out a plan of study. 
 </p>
 <h2>What will you gain?</h2>
 <ol>
   <li>Ability to compete and be successful in the local and global marketplace </li>
