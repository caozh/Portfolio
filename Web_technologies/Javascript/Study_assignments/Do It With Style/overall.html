					<h2>NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M</h2>
					<p id = "text1">The <em>NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M </em>is a mid-range, DirectX 11.1 compatible graphics card that was 
					announced in the first quarter of 2012 for laptops. It is a Kepler-based GPU built on the GK107 
					architecture and is manufactured in 28nm at TSMC. The graphics card uses a 128-Bit wide memory 
					interface with either the more common but slower DDR3 for VRAM or the more expensive and faster 
					GDDR5. Due to a higher core clock of up to 850 MHz the GT 650M is noticably faster than the 640M.</p>
					</header>
					
				<aside id = "column1">
					<h3>Architecture</h3>
					<p id = "text2">The Kepler architecture is the successor to the Fermi architecture that first appeared in laptops 
					with the GeForce 400M series. The GK107 Kepler core offers two shader blocks, called SMX, each with 
					192 shaders for a total of <em>384 shader cores </em>that are clocked at the same speed as the central core. 
					Although more shader cores are available in the Kepler architecture as compared to the Fermi design, 
					the Kepler shaders are still expected to be up to twice as power efficient. However, due to the 
					missing hot clock of the shader domain, two shaders of a Kepler chip are about as fast as one shader 
					of a Fermi chip (as the latter is clocked twice as fast). PCIe 3.0 is now supported by the mobile 
					Kepler series and an optional Turbo mode can automatically overclock the Nvidia card by a theoretical 
					15 percent if the laptop cooling system allows it. The implementation of this boost mode is done in 
					the BIOS, but it is ultimately dependent upon the manufacturer of the laptop.</p>
					<h3>Performance</h3>
					<p id = "text3">The gaming performance of the GeForce GT 650M equipped with DDR3 graphics memory lies somewhere in 
					the former 2011 high-end category between the GeForce GTX 460M and GTX 560M. The performance is exceptionally 
					good in shader-heavy DirectX 11 games and benchmarks. However, the 128-Bit memory interface can be a 
					bottleneck if DDR3 graphics memory is employed. Despite the slower core clock of only 735 MHz, the 
					GDDR5-version of the card should be much faster. Demanding games of 2011 like Battlefield 3 will be playable 
					in 1366x768 and medium or high settings. Less demanding games, such as Modern Warfare 3, are easily playable 
					with maxed out settings and 1080p resolution.</p>
					<h3>Features</h3>
					<p id = "text4">The improved feature set now includes support for up to 4 active displays. Furthermore, high resolution 
					monitors of up to 3840x2160 pixels can now be connected using DisplayPort 1.2 or HDMI 1.4a if available. 
					HD-Audio codecs, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD, can be transmitted via bitstream mode through the HDMI port. 
					However, as most laptops will feature Optimus, the integrated GPU will likely have direct control over the 
					display ports and may limit the feature set available by the Nvidia Kepler cards.<br /><br />
					The 5th generation PureVideo HD video processor (VP5) is also integrated in the GK107 core and offers hardware 
					decoding of HD videos. Common codecs such as MPEG-1/2, MPEG-4 ASP, H.264 and VC1/WMV9 are fully supported up 
					to 4K resolutions while VC1 and MPEG-4 are supported up to 1080p. Two streams can be decoded in parallel for 
					features such as Picture-in-Picture. Another novelty is the inclusion of a dedicated video encoding engine 
					similar to Intel QuickSync that can be accessed by the NVENC API.<br /><br />
					The <em>power consumption </em>of the GeForce GT 650M should be best suited for medium-sized notebooks 
					15-inches or greater.
